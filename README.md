# Formula1-Data-Visualization

This project analyzes Formula 1 race data using the fastf1 library, extracting lap times, driver performance, and pit stop insights. It processes race data by computing rolling averages of lap times and identifying slow laps based on defined thresholds. A Random Forest classifier is used to predict race performance patterns. The results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into race strategies. The project helps in understanding race efficiency, pit stop impact, and driver consistency.
